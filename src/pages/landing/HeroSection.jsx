            TokenTable is a feature within the Sign ecosystem designed to help Web3 projects and DAOs manage token allocations transparently and on-chain. It acts like a token cap table and a record of who holds what tokens but fully decentralized and automated through smart contracts.

              <li><strong>On-Chain Token Allocation:</strong> Define and record token distributions (e.g., for investors, team members, partners) directly on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and verifiability.</li>
              <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> Different participants (like project founders, token recipients, or legal advisors) can interact with the token table according to their roles, managed through permissions and signatures.</li>
              <li><strong>Vesting Schedules & Claims:</strong> Support vesting logic, meaning recipients receive tokens over time or after certain conditions, automatically enforced via smart contracts.</li>
              <li><strong>Transparency for Communities:</strong> Anyone can view the token allocation data, building trust and accountability, especially important in decentralized communities and DAOs.</li>
